  A future of financial AI in stocks and cryptocurrencies
</div>

<br/>

## 1. Introduction
                
The end of this project is to fetch financial market information, analyze them, predict next moves and finally think what to do. We have started with cryptocurrencies from **Binance** such as **BTC (Bitcoin)**, **ETH (Ethereum)**, **XRP (Ripple)**, **TRX (Tron)** and **Doge (Dogecoin)**. As _Fig. 01_ shows below, **Xunitex** gets detailed information from **Tappi.io** and takes action. Setting your own token, you would let **Xunitex** decide and automatically work with your exchange account or just send notification to your phone or defined [platforms](#3-Platforms).

<br />

- [X] Using **Xunitex** service, you must have read and accepted [conditions and guidelines](/Agreement.md).

<br />   

## 2. Features

**Xunitex** provide a GUI same as each exchange environment and there is no difference between **Xunitex** and [DCE](https://github.com/fmohtadi99/Xunitex/wiki/Cryptocurrency#digital-cryptocurrency-exchange-dce) platforms; But, there is actually a big **But**, it has a uniform structure to manage your funds from supported exchanges (_Fig. 02_).

<br />

<div align="center"><i>Fig. 02: Uniform Structure</i></div>

<br />

We decided to start with [Nobitex](https://nobitex.ir/) and expand to others. Next planned exchanges: [Binance](https://www.binance.com/), [Coinbase Exchange](https://pro.coinbase.com/), [Kraken](https://www.kraken.com/), [KuCoin](https://www.kucoin.com/), [OKX](https://www.okx.com/) and [CoinEx](https://www.coinex.com/). Also, You can offer some other exchanges in [Discussions](/discussions/2).

Besides, there are three important factors that make **Xunitex** distinguished from other same platforms:

### Light

You might have divided your funds among some exchanges and wanted to work with all of them. Instead of installing client app for each of them, you can handle your needs in just one service. Based on Cloud-Platform, you only install a GUI on your device and it connects to main source code on 24/7 strong server.

### Fast

Never lose any transaction with **FastAPI** and reach other traders. Testing on some exchanges, we observed faster order than native platform and Boom! Using lightweight library and frameworks, **Xunitex** loads real-time orderbooks as same as each exchange.
 
### Smart

The best feature of **Xunitex** is **Smart**. A new era of analyzing data and predicting. **Smart** (Xu.Smart) is a new technology based on **Python** that fetches historical data, thinks about trends, predicts next events and finally decide what to do. If you set **Smart** type to **Auto-Think**, it will automatically take action on your exchange account. Otherwise, it just send a notification on all registered platforms wheather online or offline.

Although **Xunitex** has options as many as whatever you want, but **Withdraw** has been disabled for all users and it will be accessible for [Prime+ users](#4-Pricing).
